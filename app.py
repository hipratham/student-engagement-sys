# RIU Document for Data Science
DATA_SCIENCE_DOCUMENT = """Research and Innovation Unit (RIU) Engagement Document

The Research and Innovation Unit (RIU) at Advanced College of Engineering and Management
(Acem) is a dedicated platform for fostering academic and industry collaboration. RIU bridges
the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application by providing students
opportunities to engage in research-driven, innovative projects. Our mission is to create a
culture of innovation that equips students with essential skills, prepares them for industry
challenges, and contributes to national and global advancements.

Student Engagement at RIU
1. Goals of Student Engagement
● Equip students with hands-on research and technical skills.
● Provide mentorship and resources for academic and industry-driven projects.
● Foster collaboration among students, faculty, and industry professionals.

2. Standard Engagement Procedure
Students interested in joining RIU must follow these steps:
1. Foundational Skills Requirement:
○ Students must complete a roadmap covering essential skills in their chosen track.
2. Study Group Participation:
○ Students are encouraged to use the RIU Hall as a collaborative space for study
groups.
○ Study groups should focus on sharing knowledge, solving problems
collaboratively, and completing the required learning milestones.

3. Preliminary Deliverables:
○ Before joining RIU projects, students must:
■ Complete the roadmap.
■ Submit a comprehensive report or presentation summarizing their
learning.
■ Successfully deliver a capstone project related to their track.

4. Assessment and Feedback:
○ Students' submissions will be reviewed by RIU faculty or mentors for approval.
○ Constructive feedback will be provided to ensure readiness for advanced
projects.

Roadmap for Data Science Track

Students interested in Data Science must complete the following comprehensive roadmap,
covering all essential steps from data cleaning to machine learning. All courses listed are freely

sharing your projects.)
Introduction to git and github (freeCodeCamp)

Capstone Project
Objective: Apply all learned skills in an end-to-end project.
Project Scope:
1. Data Collection:
○ Scrape or fetch a dataset from a website or API.
2. Data Cleaning:
○ Handle null values, duplicates, and reformat the data.
3. Exploratory Analysis:
○ Generate visualizations and write insights from trends.
4. Model Development:
○ Train a machine learning model for prediction or classification. (Optional)
5. Dashboard:
○ Present findings in an interactive dashboard.

Deliverables:
● A detailed project report.
● A GitHub repository containing the code and data.
● A presentation explaining the project.

Utilizing RIU Hall
1. Study Groups
● Students are encouraged to form study groups to collaboratively complete the roadmap
requirements.
● The RIU Hall provides:
○ Access to resources such as whiteboards, and internet connectivity.
○ A quiet, focused environment conducive to learning and teamwork.

2. Usage Guidelines
● Groups must ensure the space is used for productive study and skill development.
● RIU mentors may periodically observe and guide group activities.

Getting Involved in RIU Projects
After completing the roadmap and capstone project, students who demonstrate exceptional
performance and motivation will be eligible to:
1. Join ongoing research and innovation projects at RIU.
2. Collaborate with industry partners under RIU mentorship.
3. Contribute to national-level initiatives aimed at bridging the industry-academia gap.
